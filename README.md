# Go-Corona-go
A mini-game project developed using Python. I have used the PyGame library and designed my fun game features accordingly. While playing the game, users can move the sanitizer-bottle (main character) and shoot droplets of water to kill corona viruses, which are radomly spawned in the game screen.
